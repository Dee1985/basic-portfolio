Installation: No extra installation requirements for the user.

Contributions: I also utilized Pixabay's website quite a bit for the images. Also, MTG Cardsmith for their card generator.

Challenges: Creating the looping video- it's still not a smooth loop, but I am currently unable to use a video editor to create a more seamless interface, generating MTG cards in general. I also continue to struggle with flex even with the assistance of a CSS framework.

Successes: I was able to get my homepage to run the video, and I was able to complete my MTG card set. I believe these concepts are creative and unique an I look forward to improving on them.

Roadmap: With funding and extra time, additional artisitic flares will be included to sprouse up the look of my app even further.
